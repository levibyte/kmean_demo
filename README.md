# kmean_demo
Just a simple implementation of the most basic classification algorithm.
The question is following: Given K number and data, classify and put data into K buckets.
for simplicty and visbility reasons I've choosen data to be 2d points on the surface.

Overall algorithms yield is **very much** dependened on inital data ( are they allready split into K buckets or spread randomly?) and on the choice of first pivot points.


### Run examples

Left: raw data, Right: after classification to buckets ( via color )

Same, but for larger gravity values:
